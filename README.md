You've reached the README.md of Arik Karim's personal website! *Thanks for stopping by!*

## ℹ️ Overview

I made this site for two reasons: (1) to practice/refine my HTML/CSS/JS skills and (2) to streamline my research and writing work into a clean website. I wanted to make a simple, one-page website that gave you everything you needed to know about me——without the hassle of switching pages! There are small notes of nuance, from the hover-color changes for the social media hyperlinks to the rounded toggle button to switch between Light and Dark mode. 

## 🚀 Navigating the Site's Footer Hyperlinks

- Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X: pretty ubiquitous and self-explanatory!
- Google Scholar: a compilation of research papers on Google's search engine optimization (SEO). There, you can view citations of my papers by other researchers!
- Social Science Research Network (SSRN): a repository of research papers, primarily for the social sciences & humanities fields! You can find my 15+ papers in my profile.
- Substack: a self-publishing writing platform, akin to Medium or other blog sites. I publish occasionally, and all opinions are my own/are unassociated with any of my institutional affiliations.
